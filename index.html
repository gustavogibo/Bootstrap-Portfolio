                        It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters. Winter is coming. Pay the iron price. I pledge
                        my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come. A dance of dragons. Hear me roar!
                        The North remembers. The wolf and the lion. Never Resting. It's ten thousand miles between Kings landing and the wall.
